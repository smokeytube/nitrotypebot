# nitrotypebot

requirements:
```
python 3.5+

pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
pip install selenium
pip install bs4
```

## WARNING:

**Do NOT** modify botguestinstant.py to use your nitrotype account,
that is one way to INSTANTLY get your account banned.


Also try not to leave this script running overnight or for ~6 hours or
more, I don't know the anti-cheat for nitrotype and I don't want
your accounts getting banned.

You can, though, leave the guest versions of the script running for as long
as you want, as there is no anti-cheat for the guest versions.
